List, Tuples, Dictionary

List - is called a mutable (modifiable)

# a = list() --> intialize as list now a is list
# a = []  ---> another way of initializing a list
# a = [10,20,30] --> another way of intializing and assiging an element.

# a = []  later you can add an element into that

a = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7]

list element can have any data type as well itself.

a = [10, 11.5, 'a', ' dhana', [10,20,30]]

a.append('a')

Tuples - its immutable  ...

a = ()
