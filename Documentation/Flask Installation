Flask App Implmentation:

Installing Flask

Install python and keep the system ready

Now we have to install Flask and several extensions

preferred way to do this is to create a virtual environment

Create a new  application folder microblog

cd into the microblog folder and then create a virtual environment with the following command:

For Python3 : $  python -m venv flask

For Python2.X : $  easy_install virtualenv

Create Flask under the virtual environment

$ virtualenv flask

Install the following extensions.

$ flask/bin/pip install flask
$ flask/bin/pip install flask-login
$ flask/bin/pip install flask-openid
$ flask/bin/pip install flask-mail
$ flask/bin/pip install flask-sqlalchemy
$ flask/bin/pip install sqlalchemy-migrate
$ flask/bin/pip install flask-whooshalchemy
$ flask/bin/pip install flask-wtf
$ flask/bin/pip install flask-babel
$ flask/bin/pip install guess_language
$ flask/bin/pip install flipflop
$ flask/bin/pip install coverage

First Application Writings !!!

After you cd to the microblog folder, let's create the basic folder structure for our application

$ mkdir app
$ mkdir app/static
$ mkdir app/templates
$ mkdir tmp


app folder will be where we will put our application package
static sub-folder is where we will store static files like images, javascripts, and cascading style sheets.
templates sub-folder is obviously where our templates will go


creating a simple init script for our app package (file app/__init__.py)

##__init__.py file ##

from flask import Flask

app = Flask(__name__)
from app import views

###

write our first view function (file app/views.py)

### views.py file ##

from app import app

@app.route('/')
@app.route('/index')
def index():
    return "Hello, World!"

##

call this script run.py, and put it in the root folder (under microblog)


### run.py file under microblog ###

#!flask/bin/python
from app import app
app.run(debug=True)

##


Change permissions.

$ chmod a+x run.py

./run.py


After the server initializes it will listen on port 5000 waiting for connections. Now open up your web browser and enter the following URL in the address field

http://localhost:5000

Alternatively you can use the following URL

http://localhost:5000/index


When you are done playing with the server you can just hit Ctrl-C to stop it.
